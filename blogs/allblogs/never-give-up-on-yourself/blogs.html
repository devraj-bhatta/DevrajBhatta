            <p>It is not easy to be always motivated, disciplined, and consistent. Some days, it feels like the weight of the world is crushing you. Sometimes, you find yourself wondering if you can do something better in life. Being a computer student, while coding or writing a program, I feel like a genius after a successful program. But the next? I feel like an absolute dumb. It’s always a rollercoaster in the field of computer science or even in life. </p> <br><br>

            <p>May you have already heard about the name <b>Thomas Elva Edison</b>. Well, let’s learn an important lesson from Edison’s life to never give up again.</p> <br><br>

            <p>There is a man named Thomas Elva Edison (born February 11, 1847), a name we now link with the light bulb. But his life was not always full of success. In the early days, he was not a good student in school. When he was young, his teacher told him he was “too slow” to learn anything. Imagine, hearing that as a child psychology! Most people would give up at that time, but not Thomas.</p> <br><br>

            <p>Later, his mother pulled him out of school and started to teach him at home. Thomas grew curious about the world and developed a love for science, technology and innovation. At that point, he started to invent the electric bulb, but it was not that easy to build it overnight. It took him over 1,000 failed attempts before he got it right, and finally, we can use the light after his more than 10,000 experiments and more than 1,000 attempts. When someone asked him about his failures, he famously said <i>“I have not failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that will not work”.</i></p> <br><br>

            <p>Thomas’s determination and consistency taught us that failure is not the end, it is a part of the process. As the popular saying, <i>“Fall seven times, stand up eight”</i>. Every failure is stepping us towards our success. You will learn from a failure more than from a success. </p> <br><br>

            <p>So, whenever facing a challenge in life, remember Thomas’s words <i>“Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.”</i> At last never give up on yourself, because sometimes, it is that one extra step that leads you to the greatest success.</p> <br><br>

            
           <p> Happy Life!</p>
