            <p>You can’t even imagine how powerful your thoughts can be. Many people have recovered from cancer just by their thoughts and others have gone through death. Many people have earned enough wealth, got success, and made a beautiful family, and some have faced poverty, failure and familyless. In all these things, your thoughts will play an important role. Author of <b>“The Power of Your Subconscious Mind”</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murphy_(author)" style="text-decoration: none;">Joseph Murphy </a> says, <i>If you think good, good will follow; if you think evil, evil will follow.</i></p> <br><br>

            <p>Once upon a time, there was a kind man named Arjun who ended up in prison. One day, doctors and scientists told him they would make him bitten by a poisonous snake for an experiment. In reality, they only pricked him with a harmless needle, but Arjun believed he was poisoned. Years passed, and Arjun's health declined. His body showed symptoms of poisoning. The doctors and scientists were surprised. They knew they hadn't poisoned him, but Arjun's mind had become so powerful that it tricked his body into reacting as if it were true. Arjun's story spread through the prison, and soon, the entire town heard about it. People were shocked at the power of the mind and thoughts. They realized how strong beliefs and thoughts could be. </p> <br><br>
            
            <p>Your thoughts will be as powerful as your actions, and interestingly you will think before your actions, that’s why focus on your thoughts, ultimately it will direct you to good actions. Always try to think positively and be grateful for everything you have and have experienced. You can’t change what happened to you, what is happening to you and what will happen to you, so why do you worry thinking about it? Lord Krishna says <i>“timi sanga j bhayeko thiyo tyo ramro bhayeko thiyo, j hudai chha tyo pani ramro hudai chha, ra j hune wala chha tyo pani abasya ramro hune wala chha”</i> (What happened to you was good, what is happening is good, and what is going to happen is also good).</p> <br><br>
            
           <p> Happy Thinking!</p>
